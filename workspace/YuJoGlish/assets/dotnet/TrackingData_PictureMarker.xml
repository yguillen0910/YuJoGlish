<!--    Example tracking configuration file for using marker-based tracking.
        Marker tracking is the detection of markers in a camera image and
        the estimation of the camera position with respect to these markers.
        Markers, in contrast to natural features, are easy to detect with high
        precision, which in turn allows to estimate the camera position with
        high accuracy. 
        There are three different marker types that can be used:
        - ID marker,
        - picture marker and
        - rectangular image marker
        To use one or more of these markers for the tracking process, they need
        to be defined in the configuration file. If a marker is not defined, 
        but is seen during the tracking process, then it will simply be ignored. 
        Besides the configuration file, a camera calibration file needs to be 
        provided. A more precise camera calibration will lead to more accurate 
        tracking results, so it is advisible to use a high-quality camera 
        calibration. -->

                            There are two types available:
                            - "robust" to use a robust approach to detect the 
                              markers, which usually gives the best results, 
                              but consumes more computational time, i.e. is 
                              slower.
                            - "fast" to use a more simple approach to detect 
                              the markers, which is less precise, but faster 
                              than robust. 
                              -->

                    <!--    <TrackingQuality>fast</TrackingQuality> -->

                    <!--    The threshold which is used to binarize the camera 
                            image. Binarizing is the process where each pixel 
                            is converted to a grayscale value (between 0 and 
                            255) and then is set to 0 when the value is below 
                            the threshold and to 1 when the value is above. 
                            This helps to clearly identify the marker and is 
                            therefore important for the detection process. When 
                            the tracking quality is set to "fast", then this 
                            value is fixed and will not change during the 
                            tracking process. When the tracking quality is set 
                            to "robust", then the value is only the starting 
                            value in the very first frame after loading the 
							tracking.xml. Detecting markers using a fixed 
							threshold can lead to failure. The value range for
							the threshold is between 0 and 255.

							is set as "TrackingQuality", but is ignored for 
							"fast". The ThresholdOffset is adapted when no

                            With a high number, the marker tracker is more 
                            likely to detect a marker, but it also needs more 
                            computational time, i.e. is slower. -->
